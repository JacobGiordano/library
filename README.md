# Library

A small library web app built with html, css, vanilla javascript, and local storage to maintain library data.

This aims to create features typically found in similar apps while also striving to provide comprehensive keyboard support through semantic html and a11y-focused javascript.

Please feel free to [check it out here](https://jacobgiordano.github.io/library/) and start your own, personal library.

Thanks for giving this project a look!
